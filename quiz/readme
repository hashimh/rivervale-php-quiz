Some prerequisites for running the program:

1. Download and install a PHP runtime environment. I used WAMP Server (https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/). Please ensure the WAMP services are running when using this application.

2. Once downloaded, download this Githhub repository and place the 'quiz' folder into the 'www' folder inside WAMP. This path is usually C:/wamp64/www.

3. Within WAMP, check your SQL username and password. If they are "root" and the password is blank you won't need to make any changes in the code.
   If your username and password differ to the ones mentioned above:
            - Go into "end.php" and change values in lines 17 and 18, with your own SQL username and password.

4. The app is now ready to be used. Go into your web browser, and enter the link: localhost/quiz/main/main.php

Throughout the code are comments explaining what certain sections do, and why they are being used.

COMMENTS AND ISSUES:
- Had some trouble using PHP as I have not yet had a PHP runtime environment to use on my computer, as all of my previous PHP work was done on University machines (thanks Trevor for recommending WAMP).
- I ended up separating the questions into their own files. I wanted to app to display one question at a time. Usually I would have done this with JavaScript, and manipulated the DOM. This would have allowed me to have one main .js file for the questions, but still only display one at a time.
