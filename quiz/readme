Some prerequisites for running the program:

1. Have a PHP runtime environment (I have used WAMP to create this)
      -> Within WAMP, check your SQL username and password. If they are "root" and the password is blank you won't need to make any changes in the code.
      -> If your username and password differ to the ones mentioned above, please go into "end.php" and change values in lines 17 and 18, with your own SQL username and password.

2. Move the main quiz folder, containing all of these files, to the 'www' folder in your WAMP directory. In most cases this is C:/wamp64/www.

3. Now, go into your web browser, and enter the link: localhost/quiz/main/main.php to begin the application.

Throughout the code are comments explaining what certain sections do, and why they are being used.

COMMENTS AND ISSUES:
- Had some trouble using PHP as I have not yet had a PHP runtime environment to use on my computer, as all of my previous PHP work was done on University machines (thanks Trevor for recommending WAMP).
- I ended up separating the questions into their own files. I wanted to app to display one question at a time. Usually I would have done this with JavaScript, and manipulated the DOM. This would have allowed me to have one main .js file for the questions, but still only display one at a time.
