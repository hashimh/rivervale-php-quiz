Some prerequisites for running the program:

1. Download and install a PHP runtime environment. I used WAMP Server (https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/). Please ensure the WAMP services are running when using this application.

2. Once downloaded, download the 'quiz' folder from this Githhub repository. Unzip the file, and go into rivervale-php-quiz-main until getting to the 'quiz' folder. Copy and past this folder into the 'www' folder inside WAMP. This path is usually C:/wamp64/www. The new path for the app should be: .../wamp64/www/quiz/

3. Within WAMP, check your SQL username and password. If they are "root" and the password is blank you won't need to make any changes in the code.
   If your username and password differ to the ones mentioned above:
            - Go into "end.php" and change values in lines 17 and 18, with your own SQL username and password.

4. The app is now ready to be used. Go into your web browser, and enter the link: localhost/quiz/main/main.php

Throughout the code are comments explaining what certain sections do, and why they are being used.

COMMENTS AND ISSUES:
- Had some trouble using PHP as I have not yet had a PHP runtime environment to use on my computer, as all of my previous PHP work was done on University machines (thanks Trevor for recommending WAMP).
- I ended up separating the questions into their own files. I wanted to app to display one question at a time. Usually I would have done this with JavaScript, and manipulated the DOM. This would have allowed me to have one main .js file for the questions, but still only display one at a time.
- I would have liked to add some dynamic styling. Something I've done in the past with user inputs is just JavaScript to set colours on inputs depending on whether they have validated correctly or not. In this app I would have liked to fill the input background colour with either a light green or red, to further indicate the correct and incorrect answers. However, looking online it doesn't seem like PHP supports dynamic changing of styles as easily.
